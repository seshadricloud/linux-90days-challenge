# Introduction to Linux  

Linux is one of the most widely used operating systems in the world.  
It powers servers, desktops, mobile devices, cloud platforms, and embedded systems.  
For anyone working in DevOps, Cloud, or IT Infrastructure, a solid understanding of Linux is essential.

 1. What is Linux?  
- Linux is an open-source operating system kernel created by *Linus Torvalds* in 1991.  
- The kernel is the core part of the operating system that interacts with hardware and provides services to applications.  
- Linux distributions (distros) combine the Linux kernel with additional software (like GNU tools, package managers, and desktop environments).  
- Examples of Linux distributions: Ubuntu, CentOS, Fedora, Debian, Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL).  

Key Point: Linux itself is *just the kernel*. When combined with GNU tools and utilities, we get a complete operating system, often referred to as GNU/Linux.

 2. GNU/Linux vs Unix  

- Unix  
  - Proprietary and closed-source operating systems.  
  - Examples: Solaris (Oracle), AIX (IBM), HP-UX (Hewlett Packard).  
  - Licensing costs are usually high, and updates depend on vendors.  

- GNU/Linux  
  - Free and open-source, maintained by communities and organizations.  
  - Distributions are available for free or with support (e.g., RHEL, SUSE).  
  - Highly flexible, portable, and widely adopted across industries.  

Summary: Unix is proprietary; Linux (GNU/Linux) is open-source and community-driven.

 3. Open Source Licensing  

- Linux is released under the GPL (GNU General Public License).  
- The GPL ensures that software:  
  - Can be freely used by anyone.  
  - Can be studied to understand how it works.  
  - Can be modified to improve or customize.  
  - Can be redistributed, with or without modifications.  

Impact: This licensing model has made Linux extremely popular, leading to rapid innovation and adoption worldwide.

 4. Use Cases of Linux  

Linux is versatile and runs on almost every type of computing device:  

- Servers  
  - Web servers (Apache, Nginx)  
  - Database servers (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB)  
  - File and mail servers  

- Desktops & Laptops  
  - Popular distros like Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Fedora for personal use  

- Mobile Devices  
  - Android OS is based on the Linux kernel  
  - IoT Devices & E
